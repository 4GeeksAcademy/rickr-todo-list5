// TodoInput should do the following:
// 1. We want the user to input a todo item in a text box
//  1a. We want to validate the input: If the textbox is blank and the user click submit, it
//          should throw an alert to input something.  Otherwise we should append the task to the array.
// 2. We want to control the input by connecting the input tag with the useState
// 3. We want to have a button that will perform some operation to append the todo
//      to an array.
// 4. The array is the state variable -> `todos`


const TodoInput = () => {

    return (
